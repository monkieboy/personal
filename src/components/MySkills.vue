    <h1>My Skills</h1>
    <p>
      I have been working on computers since I was 18 when I bought a Pentium 166.
      I learned about HTML, CSS and JavaScript in 1998.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since then I have worked for many large and small UK companies working on the frontend
      and backend.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have seen how frontend work has evolved since then to modern with the exceptional
      libraries like Vue (this site uses Vue) and React, and the entire ecosystem.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been both equally interesting and frustrating keeping up to date with the way things work. Especially with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars">browser wars of the 90's and 00's</a>.
