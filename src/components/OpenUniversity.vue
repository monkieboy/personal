    <p>I am fascinated by the universe, I studied the astrophysics module at the Open University
      and have a deep fascination with the systems at play and amazement at the mathematics
      that describes these processes such as how the spin rate, magnetism and radiation of neutron stars
      are intimately linked.</p>
